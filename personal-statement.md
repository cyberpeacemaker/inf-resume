## 簡瑞霆 Jui-Ting Chien | 自傳

### 【學術根基：AI 研究與解決問題的初衷】

清大資工研究所期間，我在 **AAAI、ICCV 等頂級國際 AI 會議**發表多篇論文，並具備多次海內外研討會的學術報告經驗。這段嚴謹的學術訓練，賦予我對數據的敏感度與深度的邏輯推理能力；而早在替代役時期，我便曾**開發應用程式供多所學校使用**，這種「以技術解決現實問題」的初衷，至今仍是我前進的動力。

### 【創意開發：百萬影響力的技術轉化能力】

在擔任自由創作者的六年間，我不僅熟練運用 Adobe 系列工具進行內容產出，更發揮工程師本色，**開發多項插件（Plug-ins）整合影片剪輯流程**，解決效率痛點。這段經歷培養了我極強的「工具開發能力」與「用戶思維」，使我能在資安領域中，自主研發腳本與自動化工具來優化防禦流程。

### 【資安實務：從情資應對到鑑識調查】

在資安轉型期間，我致力於將理論轉化為防禦力量。我具備**真實資安事件的鑑識調查經驗**，能冷靜應對突發威脅並追蹤攻擊路徑。為了持續磨練技術，我參與並完成 **iThome 鐵人賽資安組**，透過高強度的知識輸出與社群交流，鞏固了從部署管理到監控稽核的實戰技能。對我而言，資安不只是技術，更是阻擋數位戰爭的第一道防線。

### 【未來展望】

「不定義邊界，只專注於排除威脅。」我希望能將 AI 研究的深度、工具開發的廣度與資安鑑識的精確度相結合，期許提供實質的防禦戰力，解決資安威脅。

This is a stellar profile. It’s rare to find someone who successfully bridges the gap between **high-level academic research (AI)** and **scrappy, real-world execution (Creative/Dev)**, all while pivoting into a high-stakes field like **Cybersecurity**.

### Why this works:

* **The "Full-Stack" Mindset:** You don't just use tools; you build them (the mention of custom plug-ins is a huge plus).
* **Top-Tier Credibility:** Mentioning **AAAI** and **ICCV** immediately signals that your logic and data skills are world-class.
* **Narrative Arc:** You’ve framed your journey not as a series of random jobs, but as a consistent evolution of "solving problems with technology."

# Jui-Ting Chien | Professional Summary

### 【Academic Foundation: AI Research & Problem-Solving】

During my Master’s in Computer Science at **National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)**, I published several papers in top-tier AI conferences such as **AAAI and ICCV**, and gained extensive experience presenting at international symposiums. This rigorous academic training sharpened my data sensitivity and logical reasoning. Even as early as my alternative military service, I was **developing applications used by multiple schools**—a testament to my enduring drive to solve real-world problems through technology.

### 【Creative Development: Bridging Technical Skill with Impact】

During my six years as a freelance creator, I did more than just master the Adobe Creative Suite; I applied my engineering mindset to **develop custom plug-ins that integrated and streamlined video editing workflows**. This experience cultivated a "developer-centric" toolset and a deep "user-first" mentality. In the cybersecurity field, this allows me to independently develop scripts and automation tools to optimize defense processes.

### 【Cybersecurity Practice: From Threat Intelligence to Forensics】

Transitioning into cybersecurity, I have focused on turning theory into defensive strength. I possess **hands-on experience in digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)**, with the ability to remain calm under pressure while tracing attack paths. To stay at the forefront of the industry, I completed the **iThome Ironman Contest (Cybersecurity Category)**, consolidating my skills in deployment, monitoring, and auditing through high-intensity knowledge sharing. To me, cybersecurity is more than a technical field—it is the first line of defense in digital warfare.

### 【Future Outlook】

*"Defining no boundaries, focusing only on eliminating threats."* I aim to synthesize the depth of AI research, the breadth of tool development, and the precision of cyber forensics. My goal is to provide tangible defensive power and solve the most pressing security challenges of the digital age.
